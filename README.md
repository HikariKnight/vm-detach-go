# vm-detach-go
vm-detach-go is a helper program for those using VFIO with only one keyboard and mouse and wants to be able to have their putty command on a hotkey for detaching their keyboard and mouse from the guest OS without (hopefully) triggering any anticheat software that is looking for common programs/binaries from autohotkey or python that achieves the same thing.
